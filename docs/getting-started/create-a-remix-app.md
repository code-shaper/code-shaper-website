# Create a Remix App

The Remix plugin generates an opinionated web application using the following
key technologies:

1. Framework: [React 18](https://react.dev/) + [Remix](https://remix.run/)
2. Styling: Plain CSS or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
3. Linting:
   [Code Shaper ESLint configuration](https://github.com/code-shaper/code-shaper/tree/main/configs/eslint-config)
   â€“ this is a stricter, production-grade configuration than what you get using
   `create-remix`.

You can add additional libraries and frameworks depending on your needs.

:::tip Testing and Storybook support

The Remix generator does not yet include testing and Storybook support. You can
get the latest guidance on these by following the references below:

- [@remix-run/testing](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/testing)
- [Storybook + Testing Helper](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2481)

:::

This section provides basic instructions for generating a web application using
the Remix plugin. We'll then show you how to extend this application using
additional generators and popular libraries. The final application will show a
list of top 10 movies as shown below. You can find the completed example of this
application
[here](https://github.com/code-shaper/movie-magic/tree/main/apps/movie-magic-remix).

![Home Page](./img/home-page.png)

## Prerequisite

Make sure that you have the `movie-magic` repository set up as described in
[Create a new repo](./create-a-new-repo).

## Install Remix plugin and generate an app

Install Code Shaper plugin for Remix.

```shell
npm install @code-shaper/remix
```

Now generate a Remix application. By convention, applications are created in the
**apps** directory. Let's create one there.

```shell
npx shaper
? Which plugin would you like to run? Remix
? Which generator would you like to run? app
? Application name? movie-magic-remix
? Parent directory? apps
? Package name used for publishing? @movie-magic/movie-magic-remix
? Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
```

Now execute the following commands for further setup and commit of all changes:

```shell
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Build and run the app to make sure it works
npm run build
npm run dev

# Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/.
# You should see the running app.
#
# Note: If you have another app in this repo that
# runs on port 3000, you should change the port for
# this app in `apps/movie-magic-remix/package.json`.
# Search for `3000` (2 places) and change them to
# something else.

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: add movie-magic-remix app"
```

The app is now ready to customize to your needs.

## Extend the application

Let's see how we can extend our application to show a list of top 10 movies. Run
the following command in the root directory of your repo to install the
[clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) library that we will use for this
example.

```
npm install clsx --workspace @movie-magic/movie-magic-remix
```

> Note: Do not run `npm install` or `npm ci` in any of the subdirectories. It
> will break the build. There should be only one `package-lock.json` file in the
> entire repo (at the root). See
> [Turborepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/package-installation#addingremovingupgrading-packages)
> regarding this.

## Create TypeScript definitions

Let's start by creating TypeScript definitions for data structures that we will
need in our app. Copy the following 2 files from
[the completed example](https://github.com/code-shaper/movie-magic/blob/main/apps/movie-magic-remix/src/models)
into your `apps/movie-magic-remix/src/models` folder:

1. `index.ts`
2. `Movie.ts`

:::tip Copying files from the completed example

When copying files from the completed example, do take a minute to understand
them. They are well commented, so it should be easy to understand what they are
doing.

:::

## Create a MovieList component

Now we will create a `MovieList` component that receives a list of movies and
displays it. Such components are called _presentational_ components - they don't
worry about how the data was obtained, their job is to simply render it.

Copy the `MovieList` folder from
[the completed example](https://github.com/code-shaper/movie-magic/blob/main/apps/movie-magic-remix/src/components/MovieList)
into your `apps/movie-magic-remix/src/components` folder.

## Add MovieList component to the home page

Now let's add the `MovieList` component to the home page and supply it with a
list of movies.

Start by copying the `data` folder from
[the completed example](https://github.com/code-shaper/movie-magic/blob/main/apps/movie-magic-remix/src/data)
into your `apps/movie-magic-remix/src` folder. `data/movies.ts` contains the
list of top 10 movies.

Now overwrite the home page with the following code:

```tsx title="apps/movie-magic-remix/src/routes/_index.tsx"
import { MovieList } from '@/components/MovieList';
import { getMovies } from '@/data/movies';
import type { MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node';
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [
  { title: 'Movie Magic Remix' },
  { name: 'description', content: 'Movie Magic Remix' },
];

/**
 * provides list of movies to the page
 */
export const loader = async () => {
  const movies = await getMovies();
  return json({ movies });
};

export default function Index() {
  // get the list of movies from the loader
  const { movies } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return (
    <div className="container relative mx-auto max-w-screen-xl px-8 py-4 space-y-2">
      <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
        Top 10 Movies Of All Time
      </h1>
      <MovieList movies={movies} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here we added a `loader` function to provide movie data to the page when
rendering. On the client-side, we use `useLoaderData()` to get that data and
supply it to `MovieList`.

Now execute the following commands to run the app and see the final page:

````shell
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Build and run the app to make sure it works
npm run build
npm run dev

# Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/.
# You should see the running app.
```

## Commit your code

```shell
# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add MovieList to the home page"
````

Congratulations! You have successfully built a Remix web application from
scratch in just a few minutes. This is the power of Code Shaper.
